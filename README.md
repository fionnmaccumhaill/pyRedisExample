# pyRedisExample

Here is a very simple example for running Redis in a Docker container and accessing that conainer from another Docker container running Python.

## Getting Started

This repository was tested on Docker CE Version 18.06.1-ce-win73 (19507) on a Windows 10Pro machine. I am assuming some familiarity with Docker and Docker Compose although no in-depth knowledge of either is required. The Python code has been stripped dwn to the bare essentials so you get an idea of the code you need to write in order to have Python store and retrieve key/value pairs in Redis.
